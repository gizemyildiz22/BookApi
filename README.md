I did this project as a graduation project with C#. I used onion architecture in the application. Firstly, I created entities. I created basic entities as one to many and many to many. I configured my entities using IEntityTypeConfiguration and seeded fake data using the bogus library. I completed our migration and database creation processes with the Code first structure. I created ReadRepository using Funcs. Then I created WriteRepository. I integrated the unit of work structure into my project and tried to make my project dynamic. I used Mediatr and cqrs structure. I configured my own custom automapper to use the auto mapper library effectively. I completed crud operations with Cqrs and Mediatr. I completed the exceptions for problems that may occur in the project. I built the pipeline behaviour structure with Fluent validation. I configured the rule and exception structures. I created the identitydbcontext for the Authentication - Authorization structure. For this structure, I edited my user and role classes. I built my access token and refresh token structures with Jwt. This is how I made my project work.
